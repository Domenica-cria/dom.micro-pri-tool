- For each generated feature, the user will be guided through a structured evaluation using popular prioritization frameworks.
- The tool will generate a clear, visual Feature Prioritization Matrix (e.g., a 2x2 or heatmap) or a ranked list that highlights the most valuable tasks/features to focus on.
- Users can export the feature prioritization results into their project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello, or Asana) or as a simple CSV/Excel sheet.
